# Hi! I'm Andres

## About Me

Currently a student at IE's Master in Computer Science and Business Technology (MCSBT), I'm passionate about technology and innovation and would like to get into cybersecurity once my program is over. From coding to exploring innovative solutions, I'm on a journey to expand my knowledge and contribute to the ever-evolving field of computer science. Let's connect and explore the possibilities together!

## Some Projects:

#### Portfolio Tracker
  A react.js app with a python (flask) backend created for my program's Capstone Project class. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/Amalaga19/MCSBT-Capstone) along with usage instructions.
#### Country Guessing Game
  A website developed as the final assignment for my Dynamic Web Development class (Spring 2023), it uses Node.JS to load data from a JSON file, providing clues about a specific country the user has to guess. Click [here](https://github.com/Amalaga19/Web-Dev-Final) to see the code, and [here](https://efficacious-pricey-kite.glitch.me/) to access the website, which is hosted on glitch.
#### ShapeChat
  The final project of my Live Web class (Spring 2022), it features a chat app using websockets in which a user is allowed to choose the color of the text of the message they write and the color of its surrounding bubble. The code is found [here](https://github.com/Amalaga19/ShapeChat/tree/main) and the website is hosted on glitch, available [here](https://liveweb-final-andres.glitch.me/).
#### Webcam Video Manipulation (Multiple Users)
  A website that uses p5lm (p5 Live Media) to the user's webcam feed to other currently connected users, along with three sliders that modify the user's image's red, green and blue channels, allowing users to send their webcam feeds with distorted colors. This was created using the p5 web editor and the code can be found [here](https://editor.p5js.org/amalaga19/sketches/oSIv0SJ12), the code can be ran [here](https://editor.p5js.org/amalaga19/full/oSIv0SJ12).
